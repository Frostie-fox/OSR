# OSR
Osu Song Redownloader, an app i made in python in like half an hour bcos i was bored.


# PUT INTO MAIN OSU FOLDER NOT SONGS FOLDER!!!

# info
it generates a "songids.txt" file with all the beatmap ids in case the user wants the list, and it makes a "dlsongs" folder where it puts the song.
It also reads the folder if a song already exists there, so it won't redownload maps it already downloaded in case it exits.

```
checking <MAP ID> |  <WHAT IT SAYS IN ITS FOLDER NAME (example: my author - my song)> | item <CURRENT ITEM> of <BEATMAPS U HAVE> | (<BEATMAPS U HAVE>-<CURRENT ITEM>) remaining
```
