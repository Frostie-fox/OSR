# OSR
Osu Song Redownloader

# info
To use it, at least two arguments needs to be given:

	-File or Directory: -t, True or False (False = Directory)

	-Dir. / File Name: the name of the file/directory for the song ids
There are optional arguments:

	-Outfile: -o, either False (can ignore too) or any value, which will be the file name.

	-Wait: -w, which will wait a specific time ammount before downloading the next beatmap (in seconds)

If file more is used, song data will not be printed.

# Run like this:
```
py -m OSR.py --help
```

# This only works if you didn't modify the folders in the songs folder in the osu directory, because it pulls all data from folder names.
