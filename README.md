# OSR
Osu Song Redownloader, an app i made in python in like half an hour bcos i was bored.

# info
it generates a "songids.txt" file with all the beatmap ids in case the user wants the list, and it makes a "dlsongs" folder where it puts the song.
It also reads the folder if a song already exists there, so it won't redownload maps it already downloaded in case it exits.

 
# PUT INTO MAIN OSU FOLDER NOT SONGS FOLDER!
# Run as a command prompt application:
```
py -m OSR.py --help
```
# This only works if you didn't modify the folders in the songs folder in the osu directory, because it pulls all data from folder names.
